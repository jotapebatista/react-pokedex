## Pokedex APP

This is an exercise of an Front-End Course, that aims to communicate with APIs and data processing. It uses all of the most basic concepts of react, since hooks, to components, ect.

It is not the most beautiful thing, but it's functional by now!

To run the app, follow the steps:
```
yarn install
yarn dev
```
